    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is Kevin Goodman and I am a sophomore at Mount Saint Mary's University.
    I am a computer science and cyber security major. I have been taking private music 
    lessons for about 15 years. I starting learning how to play the drums when I was 5 and
    the guitar when I was 7. I have always enjoyed playing music and I have a lot of 
    experience both performing and teaching.</p>

    <h2>Music Experience</h2>
    <p>I have been in many different music ensembles throughout school. I was in the drumline and percussion
    section at Tuscarora High School. In high school, I competed in several 
    competitions for drumline and jazz band. I also performed in countless concerts in 7 
    different ensembles. Outside of school, I have performed in many open mics and other concerts 
    hosted by private lesson teachers. My experience in teaching music comes from being a  
    leader for both the percussion section and drumline at my high school. I have taught in both group 
    and one-on-one environments, and I also took 3 music theory classes in high school.</p>

    <h2>Why Make This Website?</h2>
    <p>Even though I take private lessons for the 
    guitar, I use a lot of free online tools to get extra help and learn more than I am able to in lessons. 
    There are a lot of free ways to learn the guitar online, but a lot of websites only focus on one thing. 
    Some websites give written tutorials on how to play the guitar while others provide music and exercises 
    to learn. I wanted to make a website that gives beginners a place to learn how to play the guitar where they 
    can also practice and learn some starting exercises.</p>
